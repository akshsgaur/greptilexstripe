> OppsSource.ai is a gentle launchpad for open-source enthusiasts. It finds welcoming issues, explains them in everyday language, and pairs you with an AI buddy so your first pull request feels exciting—not intimidating.

## 🌟 Inspiration
Remember the first time you opened a big repo and instantly closed it? We built OppsSource.ai so newcomers don’t have to pretend they “get it.” The app slows things down, translates maintainer jargon, and points you toward issues that feel achievable on a busy weeknight.

## 💡 What You Can Do
| Experience | How OppsSource.ai Helps |
| --- | --- |
| **Discover friendly issues** | A curated “starter board” highlights labels like *good first issue* and shows how busy or quiet each ticket is. |
| **Understand the problem** | Each issue comes with a story in plain words: what’s broken, why it matters, and what success looks like. |
| **Follow a ready-made plan** | Tap “Guide Me” to receive a sequenced checklist with suggested files, edge cases to watch for, and test ideas. |
| **Chat with the codebase** | Ask “Where is the signup button styled?” or “Why is this warning happening?” and get answers with friendly context. |
| **Track your momentum** | See which repos you’ve joined, what’s in progress, and when it might be time to celebrate or pick a new challenge. |
